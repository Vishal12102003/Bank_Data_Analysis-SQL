# 🏦 Bank Loan Data Analysis (MySQL Project)

## 📊 Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using **MySQL** to help financial institutions better understand customer behavior, loan performance, and risk patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights to stakeholders for better decision-making.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Banks face challenges in understanding:
- Which branches or demographics yield the highest loan revenue.
- The rate of default and delinquency across portfolios.
- The effectiveness of different loan products and terms.
- Operational inefficiencies in loan disbursement and collection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze total loan volume, interest, collections, and disbursement trends.
- Study loan performance by branch, state, age group, religion, and credit grade.
- Identify default and delinquency patterns.
- Track disbursement lifecycle using `DisbursementDate` and `ClosedDate`.
- Calculate average loan maturity and unverified loan rate.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **MySQL** – Data storage and analysis using SQL queries.
- **MySQL** – Initial exploration and cleaning.
- **Power BI** – Dashboards (referenced externally in presentation).
- **PowerPoint** – Final stakeholder presentation.

## 📁 SQL Highlights

The following operations were performed:

- **Aggregations** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) across branches, states, religions, purposes.
- **Risk Flags**: Filtered and analyzed defaulted and delinquent loans.
- **Time Functions**: Used `STR_TO_DATE`, `DATEDIFF`, and date logic to calculate loan tenure.
- **Groupings** for segmentation and trend analysis.
- **Conversions** to format results (millions, lakhs, percentages).
